As of now, the application will fetch the data from OpenWeatherMapApi & display 5 set of data after internally classifying the data received from the api.

Planning to make these changes in future, in order to improve the user experience.

* An option to view the complete weather forecast details of a day when user click on any of the given date. Will implement an overlay / popup & display the data within the container

* An option to forecast data according to a users choice. This functionality will enable user to choose their own favourite place in order to forecast weather.
